*Task 1 (NumberGame):- The provided Java program is a Number Guessing Game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game begins with a welcome message and displays the instructions, stating that the player has up to 5 attempts to guess the correct number. The program uses a loop to manage multiple rounds of play, allowing the user to restart the game after each round. During each attempt, the program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. If the player guesses the number correctly, they receive a congratulatory message and the round ends. If all attempts are exhausted, the game reveals the correct number. The user can choose whether to play again or exit by entering their choice. Input validation ensures that the player's guesses remain within the 1 to 100 range.
*Task 2 (Student GradeCalculator):-The provided Java program is a Grade Calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Swing. It allows users to input the number of subjects and enter marks for each subject. The program calculates the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade based on predefined criteria (e.g., A+ for 90% and above, F for below 50%). The interface includes a form for entering the number of subjects, dynamically generates input fields for marks, and provides a button to calculate the grade. Validation ensures that inputs are numeric and within the 0â€“100 range. Results, including total marks, average percentage, and grade, are displayed in a separate panel. The design uses components like JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, JButton, and JScrollPane, providing a user-friendly and interactive experience.
*Task 3 (ATM Interface):- The provided Java program implements a simple ATM Interface using Swing for the graphical user interface. It consists of three main classes: BankAccount, ATM, and ATMInterface. The BankAccount class manages the balance and provides methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the account balance. The ATM class acts as a mediator, interfacing between the BankAccount and the user operations. The ATMInterface class creates a GUI that allows users to interact with the ATM system. Users can deposit or withdraw money and check their account balance using buttons on the interface. It includes input validation to prevent invalid transactions and displays the current balance and transaction history in a text area. The interface is built with components like labels, text fields, buttons, and a text area, ensuring user-friendly interaction. The program initializes with a default balance of 1000 and provides real-time updates on the balance.
